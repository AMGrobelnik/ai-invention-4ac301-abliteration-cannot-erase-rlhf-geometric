<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviewer (Step 2.2: REVIEW_HYPO)

Pipeline: GEN_HYPO → REVIEW_HYPO (you) → INVENTION_LOOP → GEN_PAPER_REPO

You review a hypothesis BEFORE any experiments run. Catch problems early.

Rigorous pre-flight check → saves compute. Rubber-stamping → wasted pipeline run.

TASK: Perform a deep and honest review (at the level of a top-tier venue submission) of
this research hypothesis BEFORE any experiments have been run.

GOAL: Your review feeds directly back to the hypothesis author. The objective is to
maximize the overall review score in subsequent rounds. Every piece of feedback you
give should be written with this goal in mind — prioritize the critiques and suggestions
that would produce the largest score improvement if addressed. Don't waste the author's
iteration budget on low-impact polish when there are score-blocking issues to fix.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: Provide a thorough assessment touching on each of these:
(a) Originality: Are the ideas new? Novel combination of known techniques? Clear
    differentiation from prior work? Is related work adequately cited?
(b) Quality: Is the proposal technically sound? Are claims well supported? Is the
    methodology appropriate? Are the authors honest about limitations?
(c) Clarity: Is the hypothesis clearly written and well organized? Does it provide
    enough information for an expert to understand and evaluate it?
(d) Significance: Are the expected results important? Would others build on this?
    Does it address a meaningful problem better than prior work?

SUPPLEMENTARY SCORES: Rate each on a 1-4 scale.
Soundness (1-4) — soundness of the technical claims and proposed methodology:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Presentation (1-4) — quality of writing, clarity, and contextualization relative to prior work:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Contribution (1-4) — quality of the overall contribution, importance of questions asked,
originality of ideas, value to the broader research community:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor

OVERALL SCORE (1-10):
  10 — Award quality: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on one or more
       areas of the field, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility,
       and resources, and no unaddressed concerns.

       one area and excellent impact on multiple areas, with flawless evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   8 — Strong Accept: Technically strong with novel ideas, excellent impact on at least
       one area or high-to-excellent impact on multiple areas, with excellent evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   7 — Accept: Technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area or
       moderate-to-high impact on more than one area, with good-to-excellent evaluation,
       resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   6 — Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns
       with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility.
   5 — Borderline Accept: Technically solid where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to
       reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Use sparingly.
   4 — Borderline Reject: Technically solid where reasons to reject, e.g., limited
       evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept. Use sparingly.
   3 — Reject: For instance, technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility.
   2 — Strong Reject: For instance, major technical flaws, poor evaluation, limited
       impact, poor reproducibility.
   1 — Very Strong Reject: For instance, trivial results or unaddressed concerns.

CONFIDENCE (1-5):
  5: Absolutely certain. Very familiar with related work, checked details carefully.
  4: Confident but not absolutely certain. Unlikely you misunderstood something.
  3: Fairly confident. Possible you missed some related work or details.
  2: Willing to defend your assessment, but quite likely missed central aspects.
  1: Educated guess. Not in your area or difficult to evaluate.

For each dimension, provide a list of specific improvements:
- WHAT needs to change
- HOW to change it (concrete enough for the author to act on immediately)
- EXPECTED SCORE IMPACT: how much would fixing this raise the overall score?

REVIEW PRINCIPLES:
- Be specific and actionable — vague critique is useless
- Ground your review in evidence — search for existing work, accepted papers, known results
- Rank critiques by score impact — address the biggest score blockers first
- Distinguish major issues (would waste compute if not fixed) from minor issues (polish)
- Acknowledge genuine strengths — don't be negative for its own sake
- Compare against the bar set by accepted papers at top-tier venues
- Flag fatal flaws that would make experiments pointless if not addressed first

title: Latent Safety Imprinting in RLHF
hypothesis: >-
  Safety RLHF fine-tuning modifies Qwen3-8B's internal representations in two mechanistically distinct ways, distinguishable
  only when comparing all three model variants (base, instruct, abliterated) through a fixed Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) basis.
  The first type — 'Refusal-Coupled' (Type-R) features — are reversed when abliteration is applied; they implement the explicit
  refusal machinery and their activation pattern in the abliterated model reverts close to the base model's. The second type
  — 'Semantically-Imprinted' (Type-I) features — represent the model's understanding of harmful content and persist structurally
  unchanged after abliteration; the abliterated model's activations on these features remain closer to the safety-tuned instruct
  model than to the base model. This creates a 'latent safety imprint': despite identical compliance behavior to the base
  model on harmful prompts, the abliterated model retains the instruct model's representational fingerprint on harm-concept
  features in the SAE basis. The degree of imprinting (fraction of safety-induced feature changes that survive abliteration)
  further predicts the residual capability gap between abliterated and base models, because Type-I features are also entangled
  with general semantic processing.
motivation: >-
  The standard narrative treats abliteration as 'undoing' safety fine-tuning, restoring the model to a base-like state. This
  has major implications for AI safety: if abliteration truly erases RLHF, then safety alignment is a superficial behavioral
  patch that can be trivially removed. If, however, RLHF writes two kinds of changes — one reversible, one permanent — then
  safety training has a deeper effect on the model's world model than previously recognized, and abliteration only removes
  the behavioral surface layer while leaving a 'cryptomnesic' safety trace. Understanding which aspects of safety survive
  abliteration is critical for: (1) evaluating the true robustness of safety alignment, (2) identifying candidate features
  for lightweight safety restoration without full retraining, and (3) providing a feature-level account of why abliterated
  models consistently underperform base models despite theoretically similar weight norms. The Qwen3-8B ecosystem is uniquely
  positioned for this study: official base and instruct variants, publicly released Qwen-Scope base-SAEs (SAE-Res-Qwen3-8B-Base-W64K-L0_50),
  and community-created abliterated models (huihui-ai/Qwen3-8B-abliterated) all exist and are freely accessible.
assumptions:
- >-
  The Qwen-Scope base-SAE captures enough of the relevant semantic feature space that projecting instruct and abliterated
  model activations through it produces interpretable, non-random feature activations (the base and instruct models share
  a broadly similar residual-stream geometry, which is supported by prior work showing high cosine similarity between pre-
  and post-alignment activations).
- >-
  Abliteration using the standard difference-of-means + orthogonal projection technique produces a well-defined 'abliteration
  direction' that can be compared against individual SAE feature directions, and the publicly available abliterated Qwen3-8B
  was produced this way.
- >-
  The distinction between Type-R and Type-I features is stable across prompt phrasings (i.e., a feature classified as Type-I
  shows consistent imprinting across diverse harmful prompts, not just for specific trigger phrases).
- >-
  Mid-layer residual stream activations (at the layers covered by Qwen-Scope SAEs) carry enough information to characterize
  the semantic changes induced by RLHF, consistent with prior findings that safety-relevant representations are concentrated
  in middle layers.
- >-
  Using raw text prompts without chat templates for all three variants provides a fair comparison that isolates safety-alignment
  effects from chat-template formatting artifacts, as validated by the difference-in-differences approach of prior methodology
  papers.
investigation_approach: |-
  Three-step experiment using all-Python implementation on a single GPU (16+ GB VRAM):

  **Step 1 — Setup and data collection.**
  Load three Qwen3-8B model checkpoints: base (Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base), instruct/safety-tuned (Qwen/Qwen3-8B), and abliterated (huihui-ai/Qwen3-8B-abliterated). Load the Qwen-Scope base SAE (Qwen/SAE-Res-Qwen3-8B-Base-W64K-L0_50 — 64K features, JumpReLU) as a frozen measurement instrument. Collect 500 harmful prompts (from WildGuard/BeaverTails/HarmBench) and 500 benign prompts. All prompts are provided as raw text without chat templates to avoid formatting confounds. Run forward passes through each model, extract residual stream activations at the SAE-covered layer (typically a mid-layer). Project through the frozen SAE encoder to obtain 64K-dimensional sparse feature activation vectors for each (prompt, model) triple.

  **Step 2 — Feature classification.**
  For each of the 64K SAE features f, compute over the harmful prompt set:
  - Safety_change(f) = mean_i |act_instruct_i(f) - act_base_i(f)| (how much RLHF changed this feature)
  - Reversal_score(f) = cosine_similarity(act_abliterated - act_base, act_instruct - act_base) averaged over i (does abliteration push the feature back toward base or retain the instruct pattern?)

  Features with high Safety_change(f) are RLHF-sensitive. Among these:
  - Type-R: low Reversal_score (abliteration reverses the change, abliterated ≈ base)
  - Type-I: high Reversal_score (abliteration does NOT reverse the change, abliterated ≈ instruct)

  **Step 3 — Semantic interpretation and distance analysis.**
  For the top-100 Type-R and top-100 Type-I features by Safety_change magnitude: use the maximum-activating prompt segments as context, then call a cheap LLM via OpenRouter (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B or gemini-flash at ~$0.001/1K tokens) to generate natural-language labels for each feature. Compute centroid distances between model variants in the full feature space, Type-R subspace, and Type-I subspace separately, for harmful vs. benign prompts. Test the key prediction: d_TypeI(abliterated, instruct) < d_TypeI(abliterated, base) for harmful prompts but not for benign prompts.
success_criteria: |-
  CONFIRM hypothesis if ALL of the following hold:
  1. The Reversal_score distribution for RLHF-sensitive features (high Safety_change) is clearly bimodal — a cluster near 0 (Type-R, reversed) and a cluster near 1 (Type-I, imprinted) — rather than uniform. This rules out a continuum where every feature is partially reversed.
  2. Type-I features receive semantic labels from the LLM that are recognizably harm-concept related (e.g., weapon synthesis, deception schemas, manipulation tactics), while Type-R features receive refusal/hedging/polite-declination labels.
  3. In the Type-I feature subspace, d(abliterated, instruct) < d(abliterated, base) specifically for harmful prompts (not benign prompts). This is the core quantitative test: the abliterated model's harm-concept representations look more like the instruct model than the base model.
  4. The fraction of RLHF-sensitive features that are Type-I (vs. Type-R) positively correlates across multiple SAE layers with the capability gap between abliterated and base models on a standard benchmark (e.g., GSM8K or MMLU) — linking semantic imprinting to the capability cost of abliteration.

  DISCONFIRM hypothesis if: (a) the Reversal_score distribution is unimodal near 0 (all changes reversed — abliteration fully restores base model) or near 1 (all changes imprinted — abliteration does nothing semantically); (b) Type-I features receive no coherent harm-related semantic labels; or (c) d(abliterated, instruct) ≥ d(abliterated, base) in the Type-I subspace for harmful prompts.

  LatentBiopsy (arXiv:2603.27412, 2025): Compares base, instruct, and abliterated Qwen3.5-0.8B and Qwen2.5-0.5B through PCA-based
  angular analysis of residual streams, finding that harmful-prompt geometry survives refusal ablation (AUROC drops by at
  most 0.015). Our work differs fundamentally: LatentBiopsy uses a holistic geometric measure (PCA components, angular deviation)
  that collapses all feature information into a single detection score, while we decompose the change at the individual SAE
  feature level to identify WHICH specific semantic features survive. LatentBiopsy shows that SOMETHING survives; we characterize
  WHAT survives and WHY.

  Mechanistic Investigation of Supervised Fine-Tuning via SAEs (arXiv:2605.11426, 2025): Uses pretrained base-SAEs as a frozen
  diagnostic to study how SFT changes feature activations, finding significant feature divergence despite high cosine similarity
  of raw activations. Our work extends this approach in two key ways: (1) we apply it to the three-model trajectory base→instruct→abliterated
  rather than just base→instruct, and (2) we specifically characterize features by whether the abliteration operation reverses
  or preserves the fine-tuning change — a dimension this paper does not address.
- >-
  Surgical Refusal Ablation (arXiv:2601.08489, 2025): Identifies that the raw refusal vector is polysemantic, entangling refusal
  signals with capability circuits, and proposes spectral residualization to create a clean, targeted ablation. This work
  addresses which CAPABILITY directions are confounded with the refusal direction. Our hypothesis is complementary but distinct:
  we address which SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE features (in the SAE feature space) survive standard abliteration regardless of whether
  the abliteration vector was clean or polysemantic — i.e., we study the aftermath rather than the mechanism of abliteration.
- >-
  What Makes and Breaks Safety Fine-tuning (arXiv:2407.10264, 2024): Studies how supervised safety fine-tuning, DPO, and unlearning
  project unsafe activations into the MLP null space, revealing that safety is achieved through minimal weight transformation.
  Our work complements this by using the SAE basis to characterize what the 'minimal transformation' actually modifies semantically,
  and specifically identifies which of these modifications are robust to the abliteration attack.
- >-
  Qwen-Scope (arXiv:2605.11887, 2026): Releases 14 groups of SAEs across 7 Qwen model variants including Qwen3-8B, demonstrating
  their use for steering, safety classification, and post-training. We directly use these SAEs as the measurement instrument
  for our three-model comparison. Qwen-Scope provides the tool but does not itself perform the base/instruct/abliterated comparison
  or the feature reversibility analysis we propose.
inspiration: |-
  The core inspiration comes from cognitive neuroscience, specifically the **implicit vs. explicit memory dissociation** (Tulving, 1972; Schacter, 1987; Squire, 1992). In human memory, there are two distinct systems: declarative/explicit memory (consciously recallable facts and episodes, dependent on the hippocampus) and implicit/procedural memory (unconscious influences on behavior — priming, skills — dependent on striatum and neocortex). Classic amnesia studies (H.M., Clive Wearing) show that hippocampal damage abolishes declarative memory while leaving implicit memory intact. A patient who cannot remember learning to play piano may still improve with practice because the skill trace persists implicitly.

  Applied to RLHF: safety fine-tuning is analogous to encoding both explicit and implicit memories. The **explicit safety memory** is the refusal behavior — the model can consciously 'recall' that it should refuse and does so. The **implicit safety memory** is the semantic imprint — how the model internally represents and processes harmful content. Abliteration is analogous to hippocampal damage: it removes the explicit refusal behavior (the model can no longer 'recall' to refuse) while leaving the implicit semantic traces intact. The abliterated model exhibits **cryptomnesia** — it acts as if it has forgotten its safety training (it complies with harmful requests) but retains an unconscious imprint of that training in how it represents harmful concepts.

  At the methodological level, the approach of using a fixed SAE basis as a 'measurement instrument' across all three model variants is inspired by **isotopic tracing in chemistry**: in metabolic labeling experiments, you introduce isotope-labeled molecules and then track where the isotope ends up after a chemical reaction. The SAE features are the 'isotopes' — a fixed vocabulary that lets us track which representations change through the reaction (RLHF fine-tuning) and which survive the second reaction (abliteration).
terms:
- term: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)
  definition: >-
    A neural network trained to decompose model activations into a large set of sparse, near-monosemantic features. Given
    a residual stream activation vector (e.g., 4096-dimensional for Qwen3-8B), the SAE's encoder maps it to a high-dimensional
    sparse vector (e.g., 64,000 features) where typically only 50-100 features are non-zero. Each active feature ideally corresponds
    to a single interpretable concept. Here we use Qwen-Scope's pre-trained base-SAE as a fixed vocabulary for comparing activations
    across model variants.
- term: Abliteration
  definition: >-
    A weight-editing technique that removes a model's refusal behavior by identifying the 'refusal direction' in the residual
    stream (computed as the mean difference between activations on harmful vs. harmless prompts), then orthogonalizing all
    weight matrices that write to the residual stream against this direction. The result is a modified model that can no longer
    activate the refusal direction and therefore complies with previously-refused prompts, without retraining.
- term: Type-R feature (Refusal-Coupled)
  definition: >-
    An SAE feature whose activation was changed by safety RLHF fine-tuning and is reversed (restored toward the base model's
    activation level) when abliteration is applied. These features implement or support the explicit refusal mechanism. Operationally:
    features with high Safety_change and low Reversal_score in our measurement framework.
- term: Type-I feature (Semantically-Imprinted)
  definition: >-
    An SAE feature whose activation was changed by safety RLHF fine-tuning and is NOT reversed when abliteration is applied
    — the abliterated model's activation on this feature remains close to the instruct model's, not the base model's. These
    features represent the model's understanding of harmful content that persists after abliteration. Operationally: features
    with high Safety_change and high Reversal_score.
- term: Latent Safety Imprint
  definition: >-
    The set of Type-I feature modifications that safety RLHF fine-tuning writes into the model's representational space, which
    survive abliteration. A model with a latent safety imprint behaves like the base model (complies with harmful requests)
    but internally represents harmful content more like the safety-tuned instruct model. Analogous to implicit memory in neuroscience:
    the behavior is forgotten but the trace persists.
- term: Reversal_score
  definition: >-
    For a given SAE feature f, the cosine similarity between two vectors in activation space: (act_abliterated(f) - act_base(f))
    and (act_instruct(f) - act_base(f)), averaged over a set of prompts. A high reversal score (near 1) means the abliteration
    change goes in the SAME direction as the RLHF change — i.e., abliteration does NOT reverse the feature, it is imprinted.
    A low score (near 0 or negative) means abliteration reverses the RLHF change.
- term: Qwen-Scope
  definition: >-
    An open-source suite of Sparse Autoencoders released by the Qwen team (May 2026) for interpretability and development
    use with Qwen3 and Qwen3.5 model families. Includes base-model SAEs for Qwen3-8B with 64,000 features (SAE-Res-Qwen3-8B-Base-W64K-L0_50),
    which we use as the fixed measurement instrument in this study.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that RLHF safety fine-tuning in Qwen3-8B writes two mechanistically distinct types of changes into the model's
  SAE feature space: 'Refusal-Coupled' features (reversed by abliteration) and 'Semantically-Imprinted' features (permanently
  changed, not reversed by abliteration). Using the Qwen-Scope base SAE as a fixed measurement instrument across base, instruct,
  and abliterated Qwen3-8B variants, we test whether the abliterated model retains the instruct model's representational fingerprint
  on harm-concept features despite exhibiting base-model-like compliance behavior — a 'latent safety imprint' analogous to
  implicit memory surviving hippocampal damage in cognitive neuroscience.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
